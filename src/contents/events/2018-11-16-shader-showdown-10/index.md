The Cookie Collective organizes live coding parties, inspired by the Shader Showdown from the Revision. It's a friendly competition where demoscene artists write code to produce visual effects in a limited amount of time.

We are using Bonzomatic and Atom Editor with Veda package, but any live instrument is welcome. Graph plotter, analog glitch, generative music, GPU whispering, etc.

On the occasion of the GROW - Paris Creative Coding Festival 2018 which happen in Ground Control
, we are organizing two live coding parties:

- Nov 13th will be private and only for GROW festival-goers. But we are looking for programmers to participate, contact us if you are interested.
- Nov 16th will be open for public and free
