The Cookie Collective organizes live coding parties, inspired by the Shader Showdown from the Revision demoparty. It's a friendly competition where demoscene artists write code to produce visual effects in a limited amount of time. Any live tool is welcome : graph plotter, analog glitch, generative music, GPU whispering, etc.
