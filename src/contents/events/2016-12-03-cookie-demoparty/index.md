## Cookie is a day-long demoparty, open to everyone:

- The event is free
- There is something for everyone (concerts, conferences, beers...)
- The team is friendly and eager to help newcomers

## History

The Cookie party is the child of DemoJS, but now officially open to all platforms! After the success of #FuckJS in the last edition, we decided to stick with multi-platform competitions.

To avoid confusion, a rename was needed, and Cookie was born! (you'll notethe subtle reference though ;)

## Opening time

Gates will open at 10am and the event will run until midnight.

## Concert

Grizzly Cogs will play on Saturday night!

## Detailed schedule

- 2pm-6pm - Open stage for conferences and free expression
- 7pm - Deadline for all compos
- 8pm - Compos
- 10pm - Concert: Grizzly Cogs
- 11pm - Results

## General rules

- The production must not have been released previously.
- Remote entries are allowed!
- You should only submit your own work. In particular, copyrighted material is strictly forbidden.
- You CAN start working on your production NOW. The production does NOT need to be made 100% at the party place.
- Deadline is saturday 2016-12-03 @7PM CEST
- Winners will be determined by voting from all visitors.
- Entries may be disqualified by the orga team if deemed innapropriate (pornography, illegal content...) or breaking the rules listed here.

If you have questions regarding the rules, feel free to send them to rules@demojs.org.

## Food!

For the first time, you can enter a compo with food! Yes, actual food, like, from your kitchen.

- All the dishes will lined up with a number (for voting), author(s), and weight.
- Remember that ideally everyone at the party should get a bite to be able to vote eventually. Planning for a 1-2 person dish is probably not going to make you popular.
- Plates and cuttlery will be made available at the party place, you don't need to provide them.
- Dishes will be voted for exactly like other compos, cook for win!

## Size limited intro (1k, 8k)

Play with a few bytes!

- Combined size of all files must fit within the allowed limit.
- Note that 1k means 1024 bytes or less. Counting is done in bytes, _not_ characters (beware of Unicode).
- The production has to work offline. (no HTTP server required, no internet connection).
- You are NOT allowed to retrieve content from the Internet.
- You should not use any operating system provided media files such as the "Media" and "Music Samples" directory.
- You can use built-in generic fonts such as serif, sans-serif.

## Demo

No size limit, but it must be real-time!

- No maximum filesize. However don't try to run a movie in an iframe.
- Must be non-interactive.
- You can retrieve external content from the Internet, but it is at your own risk. We shall not be liable for connection problems during demo projection.

## Music

Produce an audio track!

- Maximum length is 8min. Anything longer will be cut by the almighty god of the demoscene, so you may want to cut beforehand if you need control over the ending.
- Any music style or tech is welcome, from chiptune, amiga-style sounds to the latest hype sequencer.
- Reminder: if you are registered with SACEM, GEMA, or any other right-holding organization, you CANNOT enter this competition. (Otherwise the event will have to pay rights for your music)

## Graphics

Draw!

- Any style is welcome, from pixel art to full-on 3D!
- Please include a few work-in-progress images with your entry (from first draft to final composition, wireframes for 3D)

## Wild

Anything else, get crazy!

- From toasters to mechatronics, you can present anything fun!
- Please contact the organization team to plan ahead if you come with special hardware.
- You can also make a video of your thing if it's easier to explain or show what it is, but please also bring the original hardware if you can.

## Compo machine

The compo machine will be a PC with Windows, on which we can install software as needed (e.g DOSBox). For anything funkier than that, please bring your own hardware or get in touch with us so that we can prepare the appropriate environment for your production.
