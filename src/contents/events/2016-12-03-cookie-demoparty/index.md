## Cookie is a day-long demoparty, open to everyone:

- The event is free
- There is something for everyone (concerts, conferences, beers...)
- The team is friendly and eager to help newcomers

## History

The Cookie party is the child of DemoJS, but now officially open to all platforms! After the success of #FuckJS in the last edition, we decided to stick with multi-platform competitions.

To avoid confusion, a rename was needed, and Cookie was born! (you'll notethe subtle reference though ;)
