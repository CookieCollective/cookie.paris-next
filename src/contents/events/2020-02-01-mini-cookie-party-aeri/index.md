### Workshop Shadercoding beginner with Flopine et HÃ©lÃ¨ne Legrand

With the help of Kodelife software, come learn what a shader is and how to code your visual effects in GLSL, a programming language for the graphics card.

The workshop will start with 2D effects and gradually move towards 3D and raymarching. You will also see how to control your effect with a human-machine interface such as a gamepad or a Midi console.

### Worksbhop Notch beginner with Adrien Ravelli

Notch is a motion graphics creation tool designed for live performance and originally developed by a band from demoscene. This workshop offers a discovery of this software from scratch and will guide you step by step in the design of real-time visuals.

### Vova + ThÃ©otime

Vova :  
Far from considering himself a committed rapper, Vova presents himself simply as a polymorphic hip-hop artist with rabid prose. In his lyrical sight: capital, injustice, abuse of power, individualism... His music reflects a state of mind that is always alert and far from consensus.
