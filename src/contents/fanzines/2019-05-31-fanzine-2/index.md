title: "Fanzine #2 - Collection of Errors"
---

Errors are everywhere. Cheese is an oversight. Alcohol is a mistake. Life on earth was not planned.

Glitches and bugs are inescapable actors of the digital activity. Although avoided by most programmers, unexpected results may be a delight to the artist's eyes. To the point that video compression artefacts are reproduced through sophisticated filters.

Inaccurate raymarching algorithms create colorful, dynamique sceneries. Error messages from compilers sound like post-punk album titles. Unintended results lead to unseen connections.

This zine puts the spotlight on creative errors.
