title: "Fanzine #3 - Anaglyph Edition"
---

Anaglyph is a stereoscopic effect. It creates the illusion of perceiving the three well-known dimensions.

Without the proper device, an anaglyph image looks like a defective print result. Equipped with special glasses, our eyes have now the key to open the hidden perspective in the picture.

This zine is released in 2019, but anaglyphes have been around since at least the 19th century. It is a futurist technology from the past.
